# Genetic Algorithm

Encoding         : splitting into groups of 1,2 and 3 Example([2,2,3,3,1])

Gene             : list of marks of students

Fitness function : Mean of variance of groups (Minimizing fitness function woulg give best gene)

Crossover        : Single point crossover

Mutation         : Changing an index randomly
